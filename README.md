# Sentiment-Analysis
In this problem, we will explore how to predict the underlying emotional tone of textual data 

We will be using the dataset in the file `dataset_2.txt`. In this dataset, there are 1382 posts containing textual opinions about Ford automobiles, along with labels indicating whether the opinion expressed is positive or negative. 

Given a new post about an automobile, our goal is to predict if the sentiment expressed in the new post is positive or negative. For this task you should implement a *regularized* logistic regression model.
